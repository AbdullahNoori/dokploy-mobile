# Listeners

[](https://github.com/mrousavy/react-native-mmkv/blob/main/docs/LISTENERS.md#listeners)

MMKV instances also contain an observer/listener registry.

### Add a listener when a `key`'s `value` changes.

[](https://github.com/mrousavy/react-native-mmkv/blob/main/docs/LISTENERS.md#add-a-listener-when-a-keys-value-changes)

undefinedts
const storage = createMMKV()

const listener = storage.addOnValueChangedListener((changedKey) => {
const newValue = storage.getString(changedKey)
console.log(`"${changedKey}" new value: ${newValue}`)
})
undefined

Don't forget to remove the listener when no longer needed. For example, when the user logs out:

undefinedts
function SettingsScreen() {
// ...

const onLogout = useCallback(() => {
// ...
listener.remove()
}, [])

// ...
}
undefined
